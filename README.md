# Caesar-encryption
I got the inspiration to build an encoding and decoding system using the oldest known encryption system created by Gaius Julius Caesar.
It was definitely a fun experience. Have a go at it guys : )
Here's how the encryption works. Basically with Caesar Ciphering, each character in a word is shifted to new position specified by the writer.
This shift generates a new message which is then delivered to the recipient along with the shift amount mentioned. 
The recipient has to decode the message by unshifting the characters by the shift amount.                                                         

Encoding:
